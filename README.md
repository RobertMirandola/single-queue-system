# single-server-queue-system

This simple simulation implements a single server queueing system. With certain departure and arrival rates, the goal is to figure out the expected queueing delay. Both a simulation and the theoretical results are plotted. 

To run simulation, simply run:

`python3 single-server-queue.py`
